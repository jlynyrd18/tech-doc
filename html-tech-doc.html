                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Gold and silver have become a big part of my life over the past couple years, as has coding. I have been building sites that inform, and linking to sites that sell gold and silver. But I have never looked into
                    how those sites were made. Breaking something down and trying to explain how it works feels like a first esecially in coding. I will be breaking down at least five parts of
                    <a href="https://goldsilver.com/" target="_blank">GoldSilver.com</a>since it is one of my favorite sites to browse for news of gold and silver.
                </p>
                <h5>What parts of the site I'm breaking down</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Navigation</li>
                    <li>Slideshow</li>
                    <li>The 3 boxes that are placed as is thanks to flexbox</li>
                    <li>Simple charts with data updated everyday</li>
                    <li>The 3 columns with different news in each one</li>
                    <li>The form to sign up for news letters</li>
                    <li>Font Awesome</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="nav-bar">
                <h3>Navigation</h3>
                <p>The navigation bar on this site actually has a header above it. The bar that we want is the one that lists buy, sell, storage, ira, news, resources, and about. Without hovering over it, it could look like a
                standard navigation bar. When the mouse hovers over parts of the navigation bar a drop down menu appears to give mroe detailed options. Our focus is just the navigation bar and the drop down menus. The navigation
                bar is a list, and the drop down menus are another list within the first list. Here's an example:</p>
                <code>
                    Header:Toppings on sandwhich
                    unodered list: cheese, meat, vegetables, and sauces
                    sub unordered list for cheese: american, peperjack, provolone, cheddar, etc.
                    sub unordered list for meat: turkey, ham, chicken, etc.
                </code>
                <p>The first list is horizontal, and when hovered over one with a drop menu it has a list that drops vertically.</p>
